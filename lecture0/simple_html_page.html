    <h1>FIFA World Cup 2014 News</h1>
    <p>
        The biggest scoreline in the history of the <b>FIFA World Cup</b> qualifiers - and indeed in the history of
        international football - was recorded on 11 April 2001, when Australia beat American Samoa 31-0.
    </p>
    <p>
        This legendary match also brought global renown for <i>Archie Thompson</i>, whose 13-goal haul set a new world
        record, which stands to this day, for an individual player in a single international match.
    </p>
    <p>
        And though the defeat earned American Samoa ignominy, so inspiring has their subsequent recovery been that it
        is now the subject of an acclaimed documentary, '<i>Next Goal Wins</i>', showing across the world.
